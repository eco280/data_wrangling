This data was downloaded from https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp on September 30, 2020. The original download file is stored as raw_unemployment_data.xlsx. After downloading, the file was adjusted to give the variables clearer names and to ensure that the formats would read into R and Stata more easily and saved as clean_unemployment_data.csv. The download date from the bottom of the file was also removed.

Note: Modifying the raw data files is not recommended best practice. I have adopted it in this case because the benefits of having a clean file to work with while we learn the data manipulation basics outweigh the benefits of thorough documentation of every step. For reference, I will provide an example of how to work with the original file using computer code at a later date. If you do find that you need to modify a raw data file to make uploading easier. I recommend storing a raw version of the file and a modified version so your users can always consult the original as well.
